# INF560-Kiana-Analytics-Project
Worked with Kiana Analytics(https://kiana.io/) to improve their marketing and security solutions.  We developed a new approach to group anonymous users data based on path traversal patterns  to detect and discover user groups/ groups of devices belonging to same user. The approach was developed using real-time clustering techniques, furthering combined with offline approach using SON algorithm to corroborate the predictions from clustering algorithms. The implementation was done in python, visualizations and deployment using Oracle Cloud.
